Audio-Splice
===================================

Audio-Splice is a library which reads audio files of conversations between people and identifies switches in speakers. This library aims to flag speaker switches and splits the audio file, creating new folders containing the `.wav` files for the parts for each of the two different speakers (one containing all the parts of each speaker with brief pauses in between each new snippet of conversation).

How it Works
-------

The user is first prompted to input the name of which audio file to process as a `String`, and as an output, an `ArrayList` called `times` is generated containing the times in which the speakers in the audio file switch. In order to generate this array, the software finds the points of time in which there is little amplitude in the file (signifying that the speaker is not talking) and stores them as new values in times. `Splitter.java` then parses times, cutting apart the first audio file into many different `.wav` files at each time in times. 

How to Use the Software
-------
You will need the [JDK](http://www.oracle.com/technetwork/java/javase/downloads/jdk9-downloads-3848520.html). 

1. Clone the repository.
2. Switch into the `Java` directory, and type `javac *.java` into Terminal or Command Line to compile all of the `.java` files and create `.class` files. 
3. Type `java Processor`. You will be prompted to enter a path to a `.wav` file. 
4. There will be a folder generated one directory deeper from the path that you entered containing all of the "splits" of the `.wav` files. 

Supported Formats
-------

Currently, as the software is still in its primary phases, the only supported audio format is the `.wav` format.

Other formats that will be added as the project progresses include:

- `.mp3`
- `.midi`
